    The Additive Manufacturing Materials Database (AMMD) is built using the NIST Material Data Curation System
    (MDCS) as a backend with structure provided by NIST’s AM schema. Providing a collaboration platform, the
    database is set to evolve through the open data access and material data sharing among the AM community. As
    data sets continue to accumulate, it becomes possible to establish new correlations between processes,
    materials, and parts.
